# A bigram is a string containing two letters.
# Write a method, find_bigrams, that takes in a string and an array of bigrams.
# The method should return an array containing all bigrams found in the string.
# The found bigrams should be returned in the the order they appear in the original array.
#
# Examples:
#
# find_bigrams("the theater is empty", ["cy", "em", "ty", "ea", "oo"])  # => ["em", "ty", "ea"]
# find_bigrams("to the moon and back", ["ck", "oo", "ha", "at"])        # => ["ck", "oo"]

def find_bigrams(str, bigrams)
    bigrams.select {|bigram| str.include?(bigram)}
end
